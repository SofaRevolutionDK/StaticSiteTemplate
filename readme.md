# Static site template

### Webpack, SCSS, JS

Just a template for building static sites, catering to my personal preferences. Clone, use it, make your own version of it if you like.

- Clone

- `$ npm install`

- `$ npm run dev` to start development server - no minification or PostCSS processing

- run `$ npm run build` to build to production with minification and PostCSS prefixing
